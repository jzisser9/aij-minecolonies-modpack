This modpack is a fork of the official Minecolonies modpack, tailored for use on the Abroad in Japan Minecolonies server. For more information please visit the #minecraft-server channel on the Abroad in Japan Patreon Discord server.

This repository contains two subdirectories: `contents` and `source`.

# Contents
This is the actual contents of the modpack installed through CurseForge.

# Source
This is the modpack export from CurseForge, which can be imported through the same app.

## Installation

1. Download the latest version of the modpack from the "Releases" page as a .zip file.
2. Install the [CurseForge Client](https://curseforge.overwolf.com/).
3. In the CurseForge Client, click the Minecraft logo on the left and click "+ Create Custom Profile".
4. Click "import" and select the .zip file you downloaded.
5. A new profile under "My Modpacks" called "Abroad in Japan MineColonies Modpack" will appear; click "Play" to use this modpack.

## Joining the server

1. Launch the game from the Curseforge CurseForge client by clicking "Play" under the Abroad in Japan Minecolonies Modpack.
2. The official Minecraft launcher will appear; click "Play".
3. Once the game loads (this may take a minute), click "Multiplayer" and if you haven't already, add the AiJ Minecolonies server to your server list. Visit the #minecraft-server channel for details.
4. Join the server and have fun!

## Note on OptiFine

Originally, this modpack included the Optifine .jar out of the box, however, this caused problems when trying to import the modpack into the
CurseForge app. It also got our submission to CurseForge rejected. As such, I've removed the .jar from the modpack. However, it's easy to add
OptiFine yourself:

1. Download the latest [Optifine](http://www.optifine.net) release .jar
2. In the CurseForge app, right-click the modpack and select "Open Folder".
3. Go into the "mods" folder and drag-and-drop the Optifine jar into it.

That's it - Optifine is now installed, and you'll see the options you're used to when you launch Minecraft using the modpack in CurseForge.
